<h3 align="left">Group A:</h3>

- Consider a telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation
to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling
techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find aset of
telephone numbers (Python)

- Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions using
chaining with /without replacement.
Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys
must be comparable, Keys must be unique
Standard Operations: Insert(key, value),
Find(key), Delete(key) (python)

- A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of subsections.
Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method.


<h3 align="left">Group B:</h3>

- Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary
search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After
constructing a binary tree -
1. Insert new node.
2. Find number of nodes in longest path from root.
3. Minimum data value found in the tree.
4. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and
right pointers are swapped at every node.
5. Search a value.

- Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +-- a*bc/def and
traverse it using postorder traversal(nonrecursive) and then delete the entire tree


<h3 align="left">Group C:</h3>

- There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight
take to reach city Bfrom A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a
graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency
list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Check
whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used

- You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect
them up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to
connectdifferent pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices
with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem bysuggesting appropriate data structures.


<h3 align="left">Group D:</h3>

- Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < ... <kn of n sorted keys, with a
search probability pi for each key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has
the least search cost given the access probability for each key?

- A Dictionary stores keywords & its meanings. Provide facility
for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating valuesof any
entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/
Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may
require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the
complexity for finding a keyword


<h3 align="left">Group E:</h3>

- Read the marks obtained by students of second year in an online
examination of particular subject. Find out maximum and minimum marks
obtained in that subject. Use heap data structure.Analyze the algorithm.


<h3 align="left">Group F:</h3>

- Department maintains a student information. The file contains
roll number, name, division and address. Allow user to add,
delete information of student. Display information of particular
employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate
message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student
details. Use sequential file to maintain the data.

- Company maintains employee information as employee ID,
name, designation and salary. Allow user to add, deleteinformation of
employee. Display information of particular
employee. If employee does not exist an appropriate message is
displayed. If it is, then the system displays the employee details.
Use index sequential file to maintain the data.
